# Introduction

This guide will help you understand our infrastructure stack and how we maintain our platforms. While this guide does not have exhaustive details for all operations, it could be used as a reference for your understanding of the systems.

Let us know, if you have feedback or queries, and we will be happy to clarify.

## Terminology

Here is a quick reference for our terminology:

- **Operator:** A person or a group of people who are responsible for maintaining our infrastructure. The person is a member of the staff team.
- **Flight Manual:** A single linear guide for our operations. The term is a loose reference to the aviation industry. Each manual is a set of meticulous steps operators follow to perform any particular task in a "consistent, reliable & repeatable" manner. The idea is to minimize the risk of failure due to human biases.

> _TODO_: Add more details about the jargon we use in our documentation.
