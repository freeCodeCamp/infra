# Introduction

We build most of our infrastructure with
[Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://www.terraform.io/cdktf), a
toolkit for building and managing infrastructure in the cloud.

Particularly we can use TypeScript to write our code, which makes it easier to
define our infrastructure in a declarative way. CDKTF generates the Terraform
config that we can use to build our infrastructure.
